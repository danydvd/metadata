  <description>&lt;p&gt;Bruce Braden Peel (1916â1998) was Chief Librarian at the University of Alberta from 1955 to 1982. The publication of his A Bibliography of the Prairie Provinces in 1956 was a landmark achievement that documents the early settlement and publishing history of western Canada, and his bibliography continues to grow today as an online database called "Peel's Prairie Provinces." Named to honour Peel's accomplishments, Bruce Peel Special Collections &amp; Archives houses a world-class collection of more than 100,000 rare books and a significant collection of archival materials in two locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The University Archives is the official repository for the permanently valuable records of the university and its affiliated institutions. Archival materials that are of continuing administrative, legal, or historical value include administrative and academic records, university publications, and select private papers of faculty, staff, students, alumni, and various university-related organizations. The Archives also holds the records of many notable individuals and organizations relating to local, provincial, and federal politics, the oil sands, education, and western settlement. &lt;/p&gt;</description>
