  <description>They show a report in Chile's downtown Santiago of Paseo Ahumada. It is a very long pedestrian street where millions of people walk through each day. There are people begging, there is a man who cleans phone booths, merchants trying to sell their goods yet it is illegal and they have to pack up quickly if they see an officer come. There are people who perform, either singing or dancing. There are people who play games and gambling and can even be a good place to nap. There are people who give out pamphlets or flyers as a way of protest I think. The next segment they have the Duo Colosal on the set playing guitar and singing some classic songs.</description>
