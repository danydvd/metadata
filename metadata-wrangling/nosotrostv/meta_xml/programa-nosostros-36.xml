  <description>In this episode, Programa Nosotros shows a great documentary of a poor neighborhood that was heavily into drugs and smoking. They speak of their personal experiences with the "buzz" from marijuana, huffing, hash, meth and other drugs. Some speak of the lack of dreams caused by their social situation, and on the other hand some describe how they still have dreams but getting high lets them think their life out, and gives them solutions. Some have been users their entire life, or other long periods of time. Then, in a special Programa Nosotros presentation Ramon Aguilera sings powerful boleros, "El Dia Mas Hermoso," "Que Me Quemen Tus Ojos," "Toma Como Yo," "Ella," "Eh Hijo Del Pueblo," and "Valparaiso."</description>
