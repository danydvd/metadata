  <description>The program starts with an interview with Tilo Paiz, a Salvadoran musician who has formed a musical group with people from Canada and other Latin American countries. Then, the program shows a concert recording that was made over a year ago, but not completed until now. The concert includes Tilo Paiz y su banda Amistad, as well as Colombian dancers, a dance group called Doremi and and two salsa dancers. The program switches back and forth between clips of the concert, and segments of the interview with Tilo Paiz, who describes how the pan-ethnic group formed and explains the importance of teaching young people about their musical heritage. At the end of the progam, there is a short news broadcast about events in Latin America.</description>
